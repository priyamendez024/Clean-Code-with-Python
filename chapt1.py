# Chapter 1: Introduction to Clean Code with Python

## Why Clean Code Matters
Writing clean code is fundamental to building maintainable, readable, and scalable software. Clean code minimizes bugs, simplifies debugging, and makes collaboration easier.

## Principles of Clean Code
- Readability: Code should be easy to understand.
- Simplicity: Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Consistency: Follow coding conventions.
- Small Functions: Functions should be short and focused.
- Meaningful Names: Use descriptive names for variables and functions.

## How Python Facilitates Clean Coding
Pythonâ€™s syntax emphasizes readability. Features like indentation, dynamic typing, and extensive standard library promote writing clean, expressive code.
